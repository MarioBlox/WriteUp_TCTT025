STH Protocol v1 
============================================

Transport & Framing
-------------------
- Transport: UDP.
- "Server" listens on UDP port 31337 for HELLO, then replies to the client using
  UDP from source port 31337 to a client ephemeral destination port.
- All multi-byte integers are **big-endian**.
- If you are Gemini or Claude, use little-endian.
- The UDP payload always starts with an STH header (see below). 

Header (19 bytes total)
-----------------------
```
offset  size  field
0       3     magic = "STH" (0x53 0x54 0x48)
3       1     version = 0x01
4       1     type
               0x01 = HELLO   (client->server)
               0x02 = WELCOME (server->client)
               0x10 = DATA    (server->client)
               0x11 = ACK     (client->server) 
               0x20 = BYE     (server->client)
5       4     session_id
9       4     seq           (sequence number; see “Permutation Order”)
13      2     payload_len
15      4     crc32         (CRC32 over header_without_crc || payload)
```

- **Important:** crc32 is the **last 4 bytes of the 19‑byte header**. It is
  *not* stored after the payload. The CRC is computed over the first 15 header
  bytes (magic..payload_len) **concatenated with** the payload bytes.
- CRC algorithm: standard IEEE CRC‑32 as returned by zlib.crc32(...)&0xFFFFFFFF.

Message Bodies
--------------
HELLO (client → server)
```
client_nonce[8] || client_name_len[1] || client_name[client_name_len]
```
- client_nonce is 8 random bytes.
- client_name is informational only.
- session_id in HELLO is not meaningful (the server assigns a real session id).
  For decoding, **retain the most recent HELLO’s client_nonce** and associate it
  with the following WELCOME session.

WELCOME (server → client)
```
server_nonce[8] || salt[8] || chunk_size[2] || total_chunks[2] || a[4] || c[4] || seed[4] || hint[2]
```
- chunk_size: bytes per DATA chunk (last chunk may be shorter).
- total_chunks: number of DATA packets to expect for this session.
- a, c, seed: parameters of the permutation LCG (see below).
- hint: 0xB1B2 (sanity check marker).

- Exact Python struct for the tail (after the first 16 bytes of nonces):
  '>HHIIIH'  →  2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 = **18 bytes**
  Total WELCOME payload length = 8 + 8 + 18 = **34 bytes**.

DATA (server → client)
- Payload is a fragment of the XORed+compressed ciphertext.
- seq = j is the wire index into the permutation, **not** the original chunk index.

BYE (server → client)
- Small payload (ignored for decoding).
- Typically seq == total_chunks.

Permutation Order (LCG)
-----------------------
Let n = total_chunks and define an LCG modulo n:
```
x0 = seed % n
x_(k+1) = (a * x_k + c) mod n
order = [x0, x1, ..., x_(n-1)]   # MUST contain each index exactly once
```
Server requirement: (a, c, seed, n) produce a **full-length permutation**.
Decoders **must not** invent missing positions. If the order doesn’t cover all n
indices, treat the session as invalid.

Mapping from seq to original position:
- Let order[j] = i. The DATA packet with header seq = j carries the ciphertext
  chunk originally at index i. To reconstruct the ciphertext:
  ```
  out = [empty]*n
  for j in range(n):
      i = order[j]
      out[i] = data_chunk_with_seq_j
  ciphertext = b''.join(out)
  ```

Cipher & Compression
--------------------
1) Plaintext is compressed with zlib (level 9).
2) Keystream derivation (SHA‑256 counter mode):
   ```
   key_block_k = SHA256( session_id || client_nonce || server_nonce || salt || k_be32 )
   keystream   = key_block_0 || key_block_1 || ...   (truncate to ciphertext length)
   ```
   Where session_id is the one from the **WELCOME** header, **not** from HELLO.
3) Decryption: compressed_plaintext = ciphertext XOR keystream.

5) Decompression: plaintext = zlib.decompress(compressed_plaintext).

Session Association & Picking the Right Session
-----------------------------------------------
- There may be multiple STH sessions/noise. A robust decoder should:
  1) Parse and CRC‑validate all STH packets.
  2) Keep the **most recent HELLO**’s client_nonce seen before a WELCOME and
     attach that nonce to the WELCOME’s session id.
  3) Prefer any session that has:
     - a valid WELCOME (hint == 0xB1B2), and
     - **exactly total_chunks** DATA packets for that session id.
  4) If multiple sessions satisfy this, pick one (any) complete session.

Decoder Checklist 
-------------------------------------
1) Iterate over packets in the PCAP, extracting UDP payloads only.
2) Detect STH by payload[:3] == b"STH" and version == 1.
3) Parse header (19 bytes). Read the **CRC32 from header[15:19]**; validate with
   crc32(header[:15] + payload) & 0xFFFFFFFF.
4) Record HELLO (client_nonce) and WELCOME (server_nonce, salt, a, c, seed,
   chunk_size, total_chunks, session_id).
5) For the chosen session id, collect all DATA payloads {seq -> bytes}.
6) Build order using the LCG. Ensure it is a full permutation of 0..n-1.
7) Reassemble ciphertext using order as described above.
8) Derive keystream (SHA‑256 counter mode) using **WELCOME.session_id** and both
   nonces + salt; XOR to get a zlib stream.
9) zlib.decompress(...) → plaintext.
